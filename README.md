This project will unveil how to leverage Infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration files and AWS services to create APIs that interact with AWS DynamoDB database. We'll utilize Terraform configurations and AWS API Gateway integrations to achieve this, eliminating the need for traditional microservices or serverless functions written in languages like Python, Node.js or Java.

Instead, we'll delve into the world of Infrastructure-as-code, empowering you to build essential CRUD functionalities (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for your APIs. it's important to clarify that "zero code" refers to the absence of traditional programming languages. We'll still be utilizing configuration files to define the API behavior.
